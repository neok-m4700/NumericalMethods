Submission instructions
=====================================================================
Email your assignments to Tim (theshuo@gmail.com) and Amanda  (amanda.louise.lund@gmail.com) with the subject "[MPCS 58001] HW3‚Äù.

=====================================================================
Code
=====================================================================
Implement the following three iterative solvers for the Crank
Nicholson scheme for the 3d heat equation. For simplicity, you do not
have to be as general as in HW2. You may assume constant boundary
conditions and a cubic domain.

1. Jacobi method (20 pts)

2. Gauss-Seidel method (20 pts)

3. Successive over-relaxation (20 pts)

=====================================================================
Analysis
=====================================================================
4. Include timers in your code for evaluating total runtime
performance. Submit a plot of your code's "problem size" vs. "runtime
per algorithmic timestep" for each of the implemented numerical
methods. When evaluating the performance, use boundary conditions
equal to 0 and a cubic domain with dx=dy=dz. (10 pts)

=====================================================================
Theory
=====================================================================
Perform stability analysis for the following discretizations of the
heat equation. You can assume a cubic domain.  In other words,
calculate the 1-step growth rates for:

5. 2D and 3D FTCS (5 pts)

6. 1D, 2D, and 3D BECS (5 pts)

=====================================================================
Mathematics
=====================================================================
7. Derive the linear system for a cubic spline interpolation of n
points. Solve the linear system to interpolate a sample random set of
points generated in matlab.  show a plot of your result. (10 pts,
support document provided)

8. given the following matrix A and vector u (10 pts)

    | 7  -2   0|      	 |1|
A = |-2   6  -2|,    u = |1|
    | 0  -2   5|         |1|

do the following by hand (no use of computer)

a. compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A

b. find the coefficients of u using the eigenvector basis:
ie if we expand	u as
   u = c1*x1 + c2*x2 + c3*x3
where the x's are the eigenvectors of A, then find the c's.

c. show	that the operation in b	is equivalent to computing
S^-1 * u where S is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors
of A. hint: exploit the	orthogonality of eigenvectors to make
this a simple calculation on paper.

d. compute A^10	u
